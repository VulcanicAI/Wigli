After the player beats one wave of creatures, the hardest-to-beat ones reproduce and create the next wave. The game's creatures have their own traits that can be inherited by their offspring, including size, speed, damage, resistances, and behavior. The studio uses real principles of evolutionary biology to make the game models, including variation, inheritance, selection, and time. The studio hires teams of talented undergraduate students from the University of Idaho based on their unique skills in their respective trades, such as programming, music, biology, and writing. The studio values student experience, and their employees can develop skills like communication, leadership, and collaboration while honing their craft. If you want to check out their games, follow them on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter."

# Another powerful subclass of WigliBot is CommandBot.
# A CommandBot takes can use commands (AKA plugins) when they are added with the "With" or "And" functions. Where WigliBot takes a WigliInjection, CommandBot takes a WigliCommand, which is a subclass of WigliInjection, and backwards compatible. A WigliCommand is like a WigliInjection with a keyword, a parse lambda function, and a run lambda function. After a CommandBot sends a message, its command parser scans for its enabled commands' keywords, and if any are found, their parse function is called. If a command's parse function finds a valid command invocation, that command's run function is called with any arguments found by the parse function.
